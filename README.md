subfolder ArbitraryAPI contains 2 .py files, ArbitraryAPI.py and GUI.py
ArbitraryAPI.py is the backend of this simple program, which makes a call to an API that returns a list of free games available on steam.
GUI.py is the user interface, displaying the information gained by ArbitraryAPI.py and displaying it in a more readable way for the average user.
